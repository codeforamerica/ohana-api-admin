# First, copy the contents of this file to a new one called "application.yml"
# in the same config directory.

# This file is used by the "figaro" gem to allow you to store and use
# environment variables in the app without having to set them via the
# command line each time you run the app in development.

# Read more about figaro here: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro

# Each entry sets a local environment variable and overrides ENV variables
# in the Unix shell. For example, setting:
# OHANA_API_ENDPOINT: http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api
# makes "http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api" available as
# ENV['OHANA_API_ENDPOINT'] in the app. See config/initializers/ohanakapa.rb
# for a usage example.

# Add application configuration variables here, as shown below.

OHANA_API_ENDPOINT: http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api

# The value of OHANA_API_TOKEN here should match the value of
# ADMIN_APP_TOKEN in the API app:
# https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api
# In production, you should set this token to a long random string
# that you can generate from the command line with "rake secret".
OHANA_API_TOKEN: changeme
