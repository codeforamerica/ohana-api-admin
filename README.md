# Ohana API Admin

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin.png?label=ready)](https://waffle.io/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin)

This is an example Rails app that shows how you can build an admin interface for the data that is exposed by the [Ohana API](http://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/). It allows organization members to sign up with their email address, and allows them to update the locations that belong to their organization.

Once a user is signed up, they can be given "master admin" status
by setting their "role" field to "admin". This is done by editing the role field directly in the MongoDB interface (via Mongolab if you are deploying to Heroku using this app's default configuration). This will allow the admin to access and update all the data.

## Current status

As of July 15, 2014, the admin functionality is now available in the [Ohana API](http://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/) Rails app to make it easier to use and maintain. This repo will no longer be updated, but it will remain available as a demo application that you can use to build an external admin interface.

Note that you will need to have the latest version of Ohana API installed for this standalone admin app to work. Also note that the standalone app is very basic and is missing several handy features that have been added to the integrated admin interface.

## Demo
You can see a running version of the application at
[http://ohana-api-admin-demo.herokuapp.com/](http://ohana-api-admin-demo.herokuapp.com/).
Feel free to make changes to get a feel for the admin interface, but please don't delete any locations that you didn't create yourself. Sign in with the following credentials:

- Master Admin username: masteradmin@ohanapi.org, Master Admin password: ohanatest

- Regular Admin username: ohana@samaritanhouse.com, Regular Admin password: ohanatest

## Stack Overview

* Ruby version 2.1.1
* Rails version 3.2.17
* MongoDB with the Mongoid ORM
* Testing Frameworks: RSpec, Factory Girl, Capybara

## Installation
Please note that the instructions below have only been tested on OS X. If you are running another operating system and run into any issues, feel free to update this README, or open an issue if you are unable to resolve installation issues.

###Prerequisites

#### Git, Ruby 2.1+ (+ Homebrew on OS X)
**OS X**: [Set up a dev environment on OS X with Homebrew, Git, RVM, Ruby, and Rails](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/)

**Windows**: Try [RailsInstaller](http://railsinstaller.org), along with some of these [tutorials](https://www.google.com/search?q=install+rails+on+windows) if you get stuck.


#### MongoDB
**OS X**

On OS X, the easiest way to install MongoDB (or almost any development tool) is with Homebrew:

    brew update
    brew install mongodb

Follow the Homebrew instructions for configuring MongoDB and starting it automatically every time you restart your computer. Otherwise, you can launch MongoDB manually in a separate Terminal tab or window with this command:

    mongod

[MongoDB installation instructions using MacPorts](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin/wiki/Installing-MongoDB-with-MacPorts-on-OS-X) are available on the Wiki.

**Other**

See the Downloads page on mongodb.org for steps to install on other systems: [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)

#### PhantomJS (for running the specs locally)
[Installation instructions](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist#installing-phantomjs) for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

### Clone the app on your local machine.

From the Terminal, navigate to the directory into which you'd like to create a copy of the Ohana API Admin source code. For instance, on OS X `cd ~` will place you in your home directory. Next download this repository into your working directory with:

    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin.git
    cd ohana-api-admin

### Install the dependencies and run the setup scripts:

    script/bootstrap

### Set up the environment variables
Inside the `config` folder, you will find a file called `application.example.yml`.
Copy its contents to a new file called `application.yml` (which is gitignored by default).

By default, the app is configured to point to the
[demo API](http://ohana-api-demo.herokuapp.com/api).
To point to your own instance of Ohana API, change the value of
`OHANA_API_ENDPOINT` in your `application.yml`.

If you made changes to `config/application.yml` in either the Admin
app or the API app, or if you're pointing the Admin app to an API app
that already has `ADMIN_APP_TOKEN` configured, make sure that the value of
`ADMIN_APP_TOKEN` in the API matches `OHANA_API_TOKEN` in the Admin app.

### Run the admin app
Start the app locally:

    rails s

And visit it in a web browser at:

    localhost:3000

### Sign in
The bootstrap script you ran earlier created three users for you that you can sign in with. You can see the username and password for each user in [db/seeds.rb](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin/blob/master/db/seeds.rb). When you sign in with the first two, you'll have access to locations whose email or website domains match the domain name of the user's email address. The locations come from the [sample data](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/blob/master/data/sample_data.json) provided by the Ohana API.

The third user is there to let you try the interface as a master admin, but you can set any of the three users as an admin by setting the "role" field to "admin". To do that, you need direct access to your Mongo database. The easiest way to view and update Mongo data is with a GUI like [one of these](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/tools/administration-interfaces/).

### Pagination
To see more than one page of results, add the `page` parameter to the URL.
For example, to go to the second page of results, go to [http://localhost:3000/locations?page=2](http://localhost:3000/locations?page=2)

### Test the app
Run tests locally with this simple command:

    rspec

For faster tests (optional):

    gem install zeus
    zeus start #in a separate Terminal window or tab
    zeus rspec spec

Read more about [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus).

To see the actual tests, browse through the [spec](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api-admin/tree/master/spec) directory.


## Deploying to Heroku
First, you need to [deploy the Ohana API to Heroku](https://github.com/codeforamerica/ohana-api/wiki/How-to-deploy-the-Ohana-API-to-your-Heroku-account). Then, create a new app on Heroku for the Admin site. Run this command from the root directory of your local copy of this repo:

    heroku apps:create your_app_name

Run the Heroku deployment script:

    script/setup_heroku -a your_app_name -o your_api_endpoint

`your_api_endpoint` is the full URL to your API endpoint. For example: `http://ohanapi.herokuapp.com/api`

This script will take a few minutes to run, and when it's done, you'll see the following messages:

```
All done pushing code.
You can now visit your site at http://your_app_name.herokuapp.com
```
Once the script is done, do the following:

Run `rake secret` from the command line to generate a random token.

Use that token to set `OHANA_API_TOKEN` to the same value as `ADMIN_APP_TOKEN`
in your instance of Ohana API:

    heroku config:set OHANA_API_TOKEN=value_of_ADMIN_APP_TOKEN

Visit your site:

    heroku open -a your_app_name

You'll then want to sign up for an account to be able to edit the data. To set yourself (or anyone) as a "master admin" who will have access to everything in the database, you can set their "role" field to "admin". The easiest way to do this is by editing the "role" field directly in the MongoDB interface (via the Mongolab add-on if you are deploying to Heroku using this app's default configuration).

## Supported Ruby Version
This library aims to support and is tested against Ruby version 2.1.1.

If something doesn't work on this version, it should be considered a bug.

This library may inadvertently work (or seem to work) on other Ruby implementations, however support will only be provided for the version above.

If you would like this library to support another Ruby version, you may volunteer to be a maintainer. Being a maintainer entails making sure all tests run and pass on that implementation. When something breaks on your implementation, you will be personally responsible for providing patches in a timely fashion. If critical issues for a particular implementation exist at the time of a major release, support for that Ruby version may be dropped.
