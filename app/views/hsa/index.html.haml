  Thank you for helping us categorize these organizations!
  Each page includes a link to 30 organizations. The idea is that each person
  will take a different page. To go to a different page, add '?page=' and the
  page number to the end of the browser's website address (the URL). For example, here is
  = link_to "page 2.", "#{root_url}?page=2"
%p
  To start, click on one of the links, which will take you to the details page
  for the organization, where you will find further instructions. Thank you!
